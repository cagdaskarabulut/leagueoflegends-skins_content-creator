As a prodigious inventor and a brilliant scientist, Jayce dedicated his life to pushing the boundaries of technology. He was determined to create a better world, free from the chaos and destruction that plagued Runeterra.</p> <p>However, Jayce's peaceful ambitions were shattered when Viktor, the Machine Herald, rose to power.
