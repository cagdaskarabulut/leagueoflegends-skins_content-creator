She possesses the unique ability to shapeshift, allowing her to take on the appearance of anyone she pleases. Neeko's playful and curious nature led her to venture beyond her tribe's borders, where she encountered the world of humans and the chaos of the League of Legends.</p> <p>In the game, Neeko is a versatile mage who excels at deceiving her enemies and turning the tide of battle. Her passive ability, Inherent Glamour, allows her to temporarily take on the appearance of an allied champion, confusing her enemies and granting her bonus movement speed. Neeko's Q ability, Blooming Burst, deals damage to enemies in a target area and marks them, allowing her to deal additional damage with her empowered auto-attacks. Her W ability, Shapesplitter, allows her to transform into an allied champion, gaining their basic abilities and a temporary burst of movement speed. Neeko's E ability, Tangle-Barbs, sends out a magical projectile that damages and roots the first enemy hit. Finally, her ultimate ability, Pop Blossom, causes Neeko to leap into the air and then slam into the ground, dealing damage and stunning enemies in a large area.</p> <p>Neeko's strengths lie in her ability to deceive and confuse her enemies. Her shapeshifting capabilities make her a formidable opponent, as she can easily trick her enemies into targeting the wrong champion. Her burst damage potential and crowd control abilities also make her a valuable asset in team fights, where she can disrupt the enemy team and turn the tide of battle in her team's favor.</p> <p>However, Neeko does have her weaknesses. She is relatively squishy and lacks sustained damage, making her vulnerable to champions who can quickly burst her down.
