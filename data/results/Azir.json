He was a visionary leader who believed in the power of his people and the potential of his empire.</p> <p>Driven by his desire to resurrect Shurima, Azir discovered an ancient artifact known as the Sun Disc. With the help of Xerath, his most trusted advisor, Azir unlocked the Sun Disc's power, transforming himself into an Ascended being and granting him control over the sands.</p> <p>However, Xerath's lust for power corrupted him, leading to a catastrophic betrayal. Xerath turned against Azir, causing a cataclysmic event that destroyed Shurima and left Azir entombed in the ruins for centuries.</p> <p>Centuries later, Azir was awakened by the young mage Sivir, who sought the Sun Disc for her own purposes. Azir, now a being of pure energy and sand, returned to the world with a burning desire to rebuild Shurima and seek vengeance against Xerath.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Azir's strengths lie in his ability to control the battlefield and deal massive damage from a safe distance.

He summons a massive wall of soldiers that knocks back enemies and creates impassable terrain. This ability can be used to separate enemies, disengage from fights, or secure objectives.

With his ability to summon and command an army of sand soldiers, Azir dominates the battlefield with his control and zoning capabilities. In this article, we will delve into Azir's story, his strengths and weaknesses, his background in the game, and his place in the League of Legends universe.</p> <h2>The Story of Azir</h2> <p>Azir's tale begins in the ancient city of Shurima, a once-great civilization that fell into ruin and was buried beneath the sands. Azir, a young and ambitious emperor, sought to restore Shurima to its former glory. He was a visionary leader who believed in the power of his people and the potential of his empire.</p> <p>Driven by his desire to resurrect Shurima, Azir discovered an ancient artifact known as the Sun Disc. With the help of Xerath, his most trusted advisor, Azir unlocked the Sun Disc's power, transforming himself into an Ascended being and granting him control over the sands.</p> <p>However, Xerath's lust for power corrupted him, leading to a catastrophic betrayal. Xerath turned against Azir, causing a cataclysmic event that destroyed Shurima and left Azir entombed in the ruins for centuries.</p> <p>Centuries later, Azir was awakened by the young mage Sivir, who sought the Sun Disc for her own purposes. Azir, now a being of pure energy and sand, returned to the world with a burning desire to rebuild Shurima and seek vengeance against Xerath.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Azir's strengths lie in his ability to control the battlefield and deal massive damage from a safe distance. His passive ability, Shurima's Legacy, allows him to summon sand soldiers that can attack enemies from a distance. These soldiers can be used to poke and harass opponents, as well as zone them away from objectives or important areas.</p> <p>His Q ability, Conquering Sands, sends forth a wave of sand that damages and slows enemies. This ability can be used to poke, wave clear, or set up engages for his team. When combined with his W ability, Arise!, Azir can summon sand soldiers to attack enemies, dealing significant damage and providing him with a strong zoning tool.</p> <p>Azir's E ability, Shifting Sands, allows him to dash to one of his sand soldiers, repositioning himself and potentially escaping dangerous situations. This ability also provides him with additional mobility and can be used to engage or disengage fights.</p> <p>Finally, Azir's ultimate ability, Emperor's Divide, is a game-changer. He summons a massive wall of sand soldiers that knocks back enemies and creates a barrier that enemies cannot pass through. This ability can be used to separate enemies, protect allies, or disrupt enemy engages.</p> <p>However, Azir does have weaknesses that players must be aware of. He is a relatively squishy champion and can be easily burst down if caught out of position. Additionally, his abilities require precise positioning and timing to maximize their effectiveness. Azir also has a steep learning curve, making him a challenging champion to master.</p> <h2>Azir's Background in the Game</h2> <p>Azir was released on September 16, 2014, as a mid-lane mage in League of Legends. He quickly became a popular pick among players due to his unique playstyle and powerful abilities. However, his strength led to him being frequently picked in professional play, resulting in multiple balance changes to bring him in line with other champions.</p> <p>Over the years, Azir has received several adjustments to his abilities and base stats to ensure a fair and balanced gameplay experience. These changes have aimed to maintain his identity as a control mage while addressing any issues that may arise from his kit.</p> <p>Despite the adjustments, Azir remains a strong pick in the mid-lane, especially in the hands of skilled players who can utilize his sand soldiers to their full potential. His ability to control team fights and siege objectives makes him a valuable asset to any team composition.</p> <h2>Azir in the League of Legends Universe</h2> <p>Azir's story is deeply intertwined with the lore of the League of Legends universe. As the Emperor of the Sands, he represents the ancient and powerful civilization of Shurima. His return to the world after centuries of slumber has sparked intrigue and conflict among other champions.</p> <p>Azir's rivalry with Xerath, his former advisor turned betrayer, is a central theme in his lore. Their clash of ideals and thirst for power adds depth to their characters and fuels their ongoing conflict.
