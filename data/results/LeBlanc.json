Her kit is designed to keep opponents off balance and guessing, making it difficult for them to mount an effective defense. Her passive ability, Mirror Image, allows her to create a clone of herself upon taking damage, further adding to the confusion.</p> <p>LeBlanc's abilities revolve around burst damage and mobility. Her Q ability, Sigil of Malice, marks an enemy, and her next ability or basic attack against the marked target deals bonus damage. Her W ability, Distortion, allows her to dash to a target location, dealing damage to all enemies in the area. This ability can also be used as an escape tool, as LeBlanc can quickly dash away from danger.</p> <p>Her E ability, Ethereal Chains, fires chains that bind an enemy champion, dealing damage and rooting them in place.

Her mobility also makes her a strong roamer, as she can quickly move between lanes and assist her teammates in securing kills or objectives.</p> <p>As the game progresses, LeBlanc's effectiveness can diminish if she fails to snowball her advantage. She relies on getting ahead early and maintaining pressure on the map. If she falls behind, she can struggle to have a significant impact in team fights, as her burst damage may not be enough to eliminate tankier opponents.</p> <p>LeBlanc's place in the game is that of an assassin and disruptor. She excels at creating chaos and confusion, forcing opponents to constantly second-guess their actions. Her ability to quickly eliminate key targets can turn the tide of team fights and secure objectives for her team.</p> <p>On the website developed for the League of Legends game, you can access detailed information and videos showcasing all of LeBlanc's skins.
