Born as a normal rat, Twitch was exposed to toxic waste that seeped into the sewers from the laboratories above. Instead of perishing like his kin, Twitch mutated, gaining intelligence and a malevolent nature.</p> <p>Driven by his insatiable hunger and desire for chaos, Twitch emerged from the sewers to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting citizens of Zaun.

Recognizing his potential as a champion, the League offered Twitch a chance to join their ranks. Intrigued by the prospect of spreading his chaos on a larger scale, Twitch accepted the offer, becoming a champion in the Fields of Justice.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Twitch is a marksman champion, specializing in dealing high amounts of damage from a distance.

His low base health and lack of mobility make him vulnerable to assassins and champions with high burst damage. Additionally, his reliance on positioning and stealth means that he can be easily countered by champions with area-of-effect abilities or crowd control effects that reveal his location.</p> <h2>Twitch in the Game</h2> <p>In the game, Twitch is primarily played in the bot lane as an ADC (Attack Damage Carry).

With the right items and positioning, he can single-handedly carry team fights, shredding through enemy champions with his rapid-fire attacks. However, it is important for Twitch players to balance aggression with caution, as his squishy nature leaves him vulnerable to focused attacks.</p> <p>On the website developed for the League of Legends game, players can access detailed information and videos showcasing all of Twitch's skins.
