With his relentless aggression and indomitable spirit, Olaf embodies the true essence of a Viking warrior. Armed with his trusty axes, he charges into battle, fueled by an insatiable bloodlust that knows no bounds.</p> <h2>Background Story</h2> <p>Olaf's tale begins in the harsh and unforgiving lands of Freljord, a frozen wasteland where only the strongest survive. Born into a clan of warriors, Olaf was raised to be a fierce and relentless fighter. From a young age, he displayed an unmatched ferocity and an unyielding determination to prove himself in battle.</p> <p>As he grew older, Olaf's reputation as a fearsome warrior spread throughout Freljord. He became known for his berserker rage, a state of uncontrollable fury that granted him immense strength and endurance in combat. Legends were told of his exploits, and his name struck fear into the hearts of his enemies.</p> <p>However, Olaf's insatiable thirst for battle eventually led him to a fateful encounter with the Frostguard, a powerful and ancient order of ice mages. Seeking to harness his raw power, they captured Olaf and subjected him to a series of cruel experiments. But Olaf's indomitable will and unyielding spirit proved too strong for the Frostguard to break.</p> <p>Escaping his captors, Olaf emerged from his ordeal stronger than ever, his body infused with the power of ice magic. Now wielding his enchanted axes, he seeks to reclaim his rightful place as the most feared warrior in Freljord and to prove that no force in the world can stand against the might of a true berserker.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Olaf's kit is designed to make him an unstoppable force on the battlefield. His passive ability, Berserker Rage, grants him bonus attack speed based on his missing health, allowing him to dish out devastating damage even when on the brink of death. This synergizes perfectly with his ultimate ability, Ragnarok, which grants him immunity to crowd control effects and further increases his attack damage.</p> <p>One of Olaf's greatest strengths is his ability to sustain himself in fights. His Q ability, Undertow, allows him to throw his axes in a line, damaging and slowing enemies hit. If Olaf picks up his axes, the ability's cooldown is reduced, making it a powerful tool for chasing down enemies or escaping sticky situations. His W ability, Vicious Strikes, grants him lifesteal and bonus attack damage, allowing him to heal up and deal significant damage in extended engagements.</p> <p>However, Olaf does have his weaknesses. Despite his high damage output, he lacks mobility and crowd control abilities, making him vulnerable to kiting and crowd control-heavy compositions. Additionally, his reliance on being low on health to maximize his damage potential can make him an easy target for burst damage champions.</p> <h2>Olaf's Place in the Game</h2> <p>Olaf is a champion that excels in the top lane and jungle roles. His ability to sustain himself in fights and deal massive damage makes him a formidable duelist and a threat in team fights. His ultimate ability, Ragnarok, allows him to dive into the enemy backline without fear of being locked down, making him a great initiator.</p> <p>Olaf's playstyle revolves around being aggressive and constantly pressuring his opponents. His ability to chase down enemies with his Q and his relentless pursuit of battle make him a nightmare for squishy carries. However, he requires careful positioning and decision-making, as diving headfirst into the enemy team without proper support can lead to his downfall.</p> <p>Overall, Olaf is a champion that rewards players who enjoy a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. His raw power and relentless aggression make him a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Whether you're a fan of Viking lore or simply enjoy playing aggressive melee champions, Olaf is a champion that will satisfy your thirst for bloodshed.</p> <p>For more information on Olaf's skins and to watch videos showcasing his different appearances, please visit our dedicated page on the League of Legends website.</p> </div>" }, { "newPageUrl": "Olaf/Dragonslayer-Olaf", "content": "<div> <h1>Olaf (Dragonslayer Olaf)</h1> <h3>RP Cost: 1350 RP</h3> <h3>Release Date: March 5, 2015</h3> <p>Dragonslayer Olaf is a fearsome skin that transforms Olaf, the Berserker, into a valiant dragon slayer.

Hailing from the icy lands of Freljord, Olaf is a member of the Avarosan tribe, known for their fierce warriors. Olaf's story begins with his desire to prove himself as the greatest warrior in Freljord, a land where strength and valor are highly revered.</p> <p>Olaf's journey takes him through countless battles, where he earns his reputation as an unstoppable force on the battlefield. His relentless pursuit of glory and his willingness to face any opponent, no matter the odds, have made him a legend among his people. Olaf's signature battle cry, "I am Olaf, and I am unstoppable!" echoes through the frozen tundra, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies.</p> <p>Despite his fearsome reputation, Olaf is not without his weaknesses. His single-minded pursuit of battle often leads him to disregard his own safety, making him vulnerable to strategic opponents who can exploit his reckless nature. Additionally, Olaf's reliance on his berserker rage can sometimes cloud his judgment, causing him to make impulsive decisions that may not always be in his best interest.</p> <p>In the game, Olaf is classified as a melee fighter and excels in close-quarters combat.

His Q ability, Undertow, allows him to throw his axe, damaging and slowing enemies in its path. Olaf's W ability, Vicious Strikes, grants him lifesteal and bonus attack damage, further enhancing his sustain in battle. His E ability, Reckless Swing, deals true damage to his target at the cost of his own health, making it a powerful finishing move. Finally, Olaf's ultimate ability, Ragnarok, grants him immunity to crowd control effects, allowing him to charge into battle without fear of being disabled.</p> <p>Olaf's place in the game is that of a strong duelist and split-pusher. His ability to sustain in fights and deal significant damage makes him a threat in one-on-one engagements. However, Olaf's lack of mobility and reliance on his ultimate for crowd control immunity can make him susceptible to coordinated team strategies that focus on disabling him before he can wreak havoc on the enemy team.</p> <p>On this page, you can find information and videos showcasing all of Olaf's appearances, including the Glacial Olaf skin. Whether you prefer the frosty aesthetic of Glacial Olaf or the classic look of the Berserker, Olaf offers a thrilling gameplay experience for those who seek the thrill of battle in the frozen lands of Freljord.</p> </div>" }, { "newPageUrl": "Olaf/Pentakill-III:-Lost-Chapter-Olaf", "content": "<div> <h1>Olaf (Pentakill III: Lost Chapter Olaf)</h1> <h3>RP Cost: 1350 RP | Release Date: June 9, 2021</h3> <p>Olaf, the Berserker, has always been a force to be reckoned with on the Fields of Justice.

The Lost Chapter refers to a new chapter in Pentakill's journey, where they face challenges and embark on a quest for musical greatness.</p> <p>Olaf's journey with Pentakill began when he discovered his passion for music during a break from the battlefield.
