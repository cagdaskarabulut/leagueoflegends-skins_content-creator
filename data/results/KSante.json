In this article, we will delve into the depths of his story, explore his strengths and weaknesses, and understand his place in the game. </p> <h2>Background</h2> <p> Little is known about K'Sante's origins, as he emerged from the shadows with no memory of his past. Some speculate that he was once a powerful mage who delved too deeply into forbidden magics, resulting in his current state of amnesia.
