      "content": "<div> <h1>Aphelios (Default)</h1> <h3>Cost: N/A | Release Date: N/A</h3> <p> Aphelios, the Weapon of the Faithful, is a unique and enigmatic champion in the popular online game League of Legends. As a marksman, Aphelios wields an arsenal of five different weapons, each with its own abilities and effects. While his default skin may not have any flashy visual changes, it is the embodiment of his true essence and story. </p> <p> The default skin of Aphelios represents his original appearance when he was first introduced to the game. It showcases his mysterious and otherworldly nature, with his pale complexion, silver hair, and piercing blue eyes. He wears a dark, flowing robe adorned with intricate symbols and patterns, reflecting his connection to the Lunari, a religious order dedicated to the moon. </p> <p> Aphelios carries his five weapons, collectively known as the Moonstone Arsenal, which are seamlessly integrated into his character model. These weapons include a sniper rifle (Calibrum), a flamethrower (Severum), a boomerang-like blade (Gravitum), a chakram (Infernum), and a scythe (Crescendum). Each weapon represents a different aspect of his kit, allowing him to adapt to various situations and playstyles. </p> <p> The lore behind Aphelios is shrouded in mystery, adding to his allure. Born into the Lunari faith, Aphelios and his twin sister Alune were chosen to become the weapons of the faith. However, tragedy struck when the Solari, a rival religious order, attacked their temple, resulting in the death of their parents. Alune sacrificed herself to save Aphelios, and her spirit now guides him in battle, communicating through a telepathic connection. </p> <p> Aphelios possesses a unique gameplay mechanic that sets him apart from other champions. Instead of having traditional abilities, he relies on his weapons and the phases of the moon to dictate his actions. Each weapon has a limited number of shots before it is replaced by the next in the cycle, and Aphelios must strategically manage his arsenal to maximize his effectiveness in combat. </p> <p> In terms of strengths, Aphelios excels at dealing sustained damage from a safe distance. His sniper rifle (Calibrum) allows him to poke enemies from afar, while his flamethrower (Severum) provides sustain through life steal. His chakram (Infernum) can devastate multiple enemies at once, and his scythe (Crescendum) excels in close-quarters combat. With proper weapon rotations and positioning, Aphelios can be a formidable force on the battlefield. </p> <p> However, Aphelios also has weaknesses that players must be mindful of. He lacks mobility and is vulnerable to assassins and champions with high burst damage. Additionally, his reliance on his weapons' limited ammo can leave him defenseless if not managed properly. Aphelios requires careful planning and coordination to fully utilize his kit and overcome these weaknesses. </p> <p> In the world of League of Legends, Aphelios is a champion with a rich backstory and a unique playstyle. His connection to the Lunari and his tragic past make him a compelling character to explore. Whether you're a fan of his lore or enjoy his intricate gameplay mechanics, Aphelios offers a fresh and challenging experience for players. </p> <p> On this page, you can find information and videos about all the appearances of Aphelios, including his various skins and their release dates.

Aphelios, the Weapon of the Faithful, made his debut on December 11, 2019, captivating players with his unique gameplay mechanics and intriguing lore.</p> <h2>The Story of Aphelios</h2> <p>Aphelios hails from the Targonian mountain peak known as Mount Targon, a place where celestial beings and mortals intertwine. Born into the Lunari, a reclusive and secretive religious order, Aphelios and his twin sister Alune were chosen by the moon itself to become the weapons of the faith. While Alune possesses the ability to communicate with the moon and guide her brother, Aphelios is a mute, relying on his sister's telepathic connection to understand the world around him.</p> <p>As a member of the Lunari, Aphelios was trained in the art of combat and marksmanship, honing his skills to become an unparalleled assassin. However, his true power lies in his arsenal of five unique weapons, each representing a different aspect of the moon. These weapons are Alune's creations, forged from moonstone and imbued with celestial magic.</p> <p>Each weapon grants Aphelios a distinct set of abilities, allowing him to adapt to various situations on the battlefield. The weapons are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Calibrum:</strong> The Rifle - A long-range weapon that excels at poking enemies from a distance.</li> <li><strong>Severum:</strong> The Scythe Pistol - A weapon that grants Aphelios life steal and close-range sustain.</li> <li><strong>Gravitum:</strong> The Cannon - A weapon that slows enemies and sets them up for crowd control.</li> <li><strong>Infernum:</strong> The Flamethrower - A weapon that deals area-of-effect damage, perfect for team fights.</li> <li><strong>Crescendum:</strong> The Chakram - A weapon that excels at close-range combat and can be thrown as a boomerang.</li> </ul> <p>What makes Aphelios truly unique is that he can only wield two weapons at a time, cycling through them as he uses his abilities.

Aphelios must also manage his ammo count, ensuring he has enough to utilize his abilities effectively.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Aphelios possesses a diverse set of strengths and weaknesses, making him a versatile champion in the right hands. His long-range poke with Calibrum allows him to harass enemies from a safe distance, while Severum provides sustain and survivability in close-quarters combat. Gravitum's crowd control potential can be devastating when combined with Aphelios' team, and Infernum's area-of-effect damage can decimate entire groups of enemies. Lastly, Crescendum's boomerang-like attacks make Aphelios a formidable duelist.</p> <p>However, Aphelios also has his fair share of weaknesses. His reliance on his weapons and ammo management can leave him vulnerable if caught off-guard or forced into extended fights. Additionally, his lack of mobility makes him an easy target for assassins and champions with gap-closing abilities. Aphelios requires careful positioning and coordination with his team to maximize his potential.</p> <h2>Aphelios in the Game</h2> <p>Aphelios' arrival in the League of Legends brought a new level of complexity to the game.
