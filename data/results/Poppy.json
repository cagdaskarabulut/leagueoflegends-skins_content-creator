With her unwavering determination and immense strength, she has become a beloved character among players.

Determined to protect her kingdom and the hammer's power, Poppy embarks on a quest to find a worthy successor who can wield the weapon's might responsibly.</p> <p>Throughout her adventures, Poppy encounters various champions from different factions, including the yordle inventor Heimerdinger and the enigmatic Targonian Aspect, Taric. These encounters not only shape her character but also provide insights into the vast world of League of Legends.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Poppy's kit is designed to excel in close-quarters combat, making her a formidable force on the battlefield. Her passive ability, Iron Ambassador, empowers her basic attacks, allowing her to deal bonus damage and potentially knock back her enemies.

When activated, Poppy gains a shield and becomes immune to crowd control effects, such as stuns and slows. This ability not only provides her with survivability but also allows her to disrupt enemy engages and protect her allies.</p> <p>Poppy's E ability, Heroic Charge, is a skillshot that allows her to dash towards an enemy, stunning them upon impact with a wall or terrain. This ability is crucial for initiating fights and catching out-of-position enemies. Additionally, her ultimate ability, Keeper's Verdict, unleashes a massive shockwave that knocks back all enemies in a target direction, potentially creating game-changing plays.</p> <p>While Poppy possesses many strengths, she also has her fair share of weaknesses. Her early game can be challenging, as she relies heavily on her abilities to deal damage, making her susceptible to mana constraints. Additionally, her lack of ranged abilities can make it difficult for her to farm safely against champions with long-range poke.</p> <p>Furthermore, Poppy's ultimate ability, while powerful, requires precise positioning and timing to maximize its effectiveness. Misusing Keeper's Verdict can result in missed opportunities or even unintended enemy escapes. Players must carefully consider when and where to unleash this devastating ability.</p> <h2>Poppy's Background in the Game</h2> <p>Poppy has been a part of League of Legends since its early days, having been released on February 13, 2010.
