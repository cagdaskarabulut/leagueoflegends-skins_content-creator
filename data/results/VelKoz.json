Released on January 15, 2015, this skin offers a chilling and awe-inspiring transformation for the Void creature. With its icy blue hues and frosty effects, Blackfrost Vel'Koz embodies the essence of the frozen void.</p> <p>The Blackfrost Vel'Koz skin introduces a new visual theme to the champion, replacing his usual purple and red color scheme with a cold and icy aesthetic. The skin features Vel'Koz's body covered in frost, with shards of ice protruding from his limbs. His tentacles, usually glowing with purple energy, are now encased in ice, emanating an eerie blue glow. The skin also includes new particle effects, such as icy projectiles and frosty explosions, adding an extra layer of visual appeal to Vel'Koz's abilities.</p> <p>Furthermore, Blackfrost Vel'Koz has unique recall animation, where he freezes himself in a block of ice and shatters it upon completion. This attention to detail enhances the overall thematic experience of the skin, making it a must-have for Vel'Koz enthusiasts and collectors alike.</p> <p>Now, let's delve into the story of Vel'Koz and his place in the League of Legends universe. Vel'Koz is a Voidborn entity, hailing from the dark and mysterious realm known as the Void. Unlike other Void creatures, Vel'Koz is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to understand the world around him. He sees the world as a series of equations and seeks to analyze and deconstruct everything in his path.</p> <p>In the game, Vel'Koz is a mage champion known for his long-range poke and devastating burst damage.

His W ability, Void Rift, creates a rift that damages and slows enemies who pass through it. His E ability, Tectonic Disruption, sends out a shockwave that knocks up enemies and applies a slow. Finally, his ultimate ability, Lifeform Disintegration Ray, fires a massive laser beam that deals immense damage to all enemies in its path.</p> <p>While Vel'Koz excels at dealing damage from a distance, he is relatively immobile and vulnerable to crowd control. Champions with high mobility and the ability to close the gap quickly can pose a significant threat to him.
