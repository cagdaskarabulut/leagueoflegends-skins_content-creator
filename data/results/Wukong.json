He was released on February 21, 2011, and has since become a beloved and iconic character in the game. With his agility, cunning, and mischievous nature, Wukong brings a unique playstyle to the Summoner's Rift.</p> <h2>The Legend of Wukong</h2> <p>Wukong's story is deeply rooted in Chinese mythology. According to the ancient legends, Wukong was born from a stone egg on the mystical Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. He possessed incredible strength and agility, making him a formidable opponent to anyone who dared to challenge him. Wukong's desire for power led him to seek immortality, and he embarked on a journey to learn the secrets of the gods.</p> <p>After countless trials and tribulations, Wukong eventually became the disciple of the powerful Taoist master, Subhuti. Under Subhuti's guidance, Wukong honed his skills and learned the art of transformation, allowing him to take on various forms and shapes. With his newfound abilities, Wukong became known as the Monkey King, revered and feared by all.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Wukong is a versatile champion who excels in both offense and defense. His kit allows him to engage in team fights, assassinate squishy targets, and escape dangerous situations. One of his greatest strengths is his ability to deceive enemies with his decoy, which can confuse opponents and provide opportunities for strategic plays.</p> <p>His passive ability, Stone Skin, grants him bonus armor and magic resistance, making him naturally tanky and resilient. This allows Wukong to withstand heavy damage and survive in team fights. Additionally, his Q ability, Crushing Blow, empowers his next basic attack, dealing bonus damage and reducing the enemy's armor. This ability synergizes well with his ultimate, Cyclone, which deals massive area-of-effect damage and knocks up enemies.</p> <p>However, Wukong also has his weaknesses. He heavily relies on his abilities to deal damage, making him vulnerable when his abilities are on cooldown. Additionally, he lacks sustain and can be easily poked down by ranged champions in the laning phase.

His high mobility and burst damage make him a strong pick for players who enjoy aggressive playstyles. Wukong's ability to engage and disrupt team fights makes him a valuable asset to any team composition.</p> <p>Wukong's playstyle revolves around utilizing his decoy to confuse enemies and initiate fights. By using his W ability, Decoy, Wukong can create a clone of himself, which can be controlled to deceive opponents. This ability can be used to escape dangerous situations, initiate ganks, or confuse enemies in team fights.</p> <p>His E ability, Nimbus Strike, allows Wukong to dash to a target enemy, dealing damage and granting him attack speed for a short duration. This ability can be used to engage or disengage from fights, as well as to quickly clear jungle camps when playing as a jungler.</p> <p>Wukong's ultimate ability, Cyclone, is a game-changer. When activated, Wukong spins around, damaging and knocking up enemies in the area.
