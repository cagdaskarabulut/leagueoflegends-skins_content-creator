Known for his boisterous personality and love for a good drink, Gragas brings a unique and entertaining playstyle to the game. With his release date on February 2, 2010, Gragas has been a part of the League of Legends roster for over a decade.</p> <h2>Background Story</h2> <p>Gragas hails from the Freljord, a harsh and unforgiving land known for its icy tundras and fierce warriors. However, Gragas was never one to conform to the traditional ways of his people. Instead of seeking glory on the battlefield, Gragas found his passion in brewing and consuming copious amounts of alcohol.</p> <p>His love for brewing led him to create a potent and explosive concoction known as "Graggy Ice," which quickly gained popularity among the people of the Freljord. However, Gragas' unruly behavior and disregard for authority often landed him in trouble with the law. He became a notorious troublemaker, causing chaos wherever he went.</p> <p>Despite his rebellious nature, Gragas possesses a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the art of brewing. He is always on the lookout for new ingredients and flavors to experiment with, often traveling to distant lands in search of inspiration for his next creation.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Gragas is a versatile champion with a range of strengths and weaknesses that make him a formidable force on the battlefield.

His abilities have relatively high cooldowns, making him vulnerable during the downtime between casts. Additionally, Gragas relies heavily on his skill shots, meaning that players must have good accuracy and prediction to maximize his effectiveness.</p> <p>Furthermore, Gragas' tankiness is not as high as some other champions in the game, which means he can be easily burst down if caught out of position.
