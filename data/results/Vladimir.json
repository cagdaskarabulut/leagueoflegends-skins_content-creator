Born into a noble family, Vladimir possessed an innate fascination with the forbidden arts of blood magic. As he delved deeper into the secrets of hemomancy, he discovered the ability to manipulate the life essence of others, granting him immortality and unparalleled power.</p> <p>However, Vladimir's thirst for power led him down a dark path.
