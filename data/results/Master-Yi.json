He is a master of the ancient martial art of Wuju, which focuses on the use of precision and agility in combat. With his exceptional skills, Master Yi became a legendary figure in Ionia, revered for his mastery of the blade.</p> <p>However, Master Yi's peaceful life was shattered when Noxus invaded Ionia. Determined to protect his homeland, he joined the resistance and fought valiantly against the Noxian forces. During the war, Master Yi's village was destroyed, and he was left as the sole survivor. Fueled by vengeance, he dedicated himself to honing his skills and seeking justice for his fallen comrades.</p> <p>In the League of Legends, Master Yi is a melee carry champion who excels in dealing high amounts of damage. His abilities revolve around his agility and speed, allowing him to swiftly strike down his enemies. His Q ability, Alpha Strike, allows him to dash between multiple targets, dealing damage with each strike. His W ability, Meditate, grants him increased health regeneration and damage reduction, making him a formidable duelist. His E ability, Wuju Style, enhances his basic attacks, increasing his damage output. Finally, his ultimate ability, Highlander, grants him increased movement and attack speed, making him a deadly force on the battlefield.</p> <p>Master Yi's strengths lie in his ability to quickly eliminate squishy targets and split push effectively. With his high damage output and mobility, he can swiftly take down enemies and escape before they have a chance to retaliate. However, he is relatively squishy himself and lacks crowd control abilities, making him vulnerable to crowd control effects and burst damage.</p> <p>In the game, Master Yi is often played in the jungle role, where his fast clear speed and mobility allow him to farm efficiently and gank lanes. He can also be played in the top lane as a split pusher, taking advantage of his ability to quickly take down turrets and pressure multiple lanes simultaneously.</p> <p>On this page, you can find information and videos about all the appearances of Master Yi, including the Blood Moon Master Yi skin.
