One such champion is Fizz, a mischievous and agile Yordle who hails from the depths of the ocean. Fizz is known for his playful nature and his ability to outmaneuver his opponents with ease. Over the years, Fizz has received several skins, each offering a fresh take on his character. One of the most popular and visually striking skins for Fizz is "Void Fizz." </p> <p> Void Fizz is a skin that takes Fizz's aquatic theme and infuses it with the dark and mysterious energy of the Void. The Void is a terrifying and otherworldly dimension that exists parallel to Runeterra, the world in which League of Legends is set. It is a place of chaos and corruption, where monstrous creatures and dark magic reign supreme. Void Fizz embodies this dark energy, transforming Fizz into a creature of the Void. </p> <p> In his Void Fizz form, Fizz's appearance undergoes a dramatic change. His once vibrant blue skin turns a deep shade of purple, with glowing void energy pulsating through his body. His eyes become a haunting shade of purple, and his teeth sharpen into menacing fangs. Fizz's trident, which he wields with deadly precision, is also transformed by the Void's power. It becomes a twisted and jagged weapon, crackling with dark energy. </p> <p> The abilities of Void Fizz are also altered to match his new appearance. His Q ability, "Urchin Strike," sees Fizz dash towards his target, dealing damage and applying on-hit effects. In his Void Fizz form, this ability takes on a more sinister look, with void energy trailing behind Fizz as he lunges towards his enemies. His W ability, "Seastone Trident," causes Fizz's next basic attack to deal bonus magic damage and apply a grievous wound effect. In Void Fizz form, this ability is enhanced by the Void's power, leaving a trail of dark energy in its wake. Fizz's E ability, "Playful / Trickster," allows him to become untargetable and leap into the air, before splashing down and damaging nearby enemies. In Void Fizz form, this ability is accompanied by a burst of void energy, leaving a trail of darkness in Fizz's wake. Finally, Fizz's ultimate ability, "Chum the Waters," sees him summon a giant shark to devour his enemies. In Void Fizz form, this ability summons a terrifying void creature instead, adding an extra layer of darkness to Fizz's arsenal. </p> <p> Now that we've explored the details of Void Fizz's appearance and abilities, let's delve into the story of Fizz himself. Fizz is a Yordle who was once a part of a tribe known as the Marai, who lived in the oceans surrounding Bilgewater. The Marai were protectors of an ancient artifact called the Moonstone, which held immense power. However, the Moonstone was stolen by a group of humans, leading to the downfall of the Marai and the scattering of their tribe. </p> <p> Fizz, determined to reclaim the Moonstone and restore his tribe's honor, ventured into the treacherous depths of the ocean. It was during his journey that Fizz encountered the Void, a force that corrupted and twisted everything it touched. Fizz, being a nimble and resourceful Yordle, managed to resist the Void's influence and harnessed its power instead. This transformation gave birth to Void Fizz, a formidable champion who wields the dark energy of the Void against his enemies. </p> <p> In the world of League of Legends, Fizz is known for his agility and ability to outmaneuver his opponents. His playful nature and mischievous personality make him a fan-favorite among players. Fizz excels at diving into the heart of the enemy team, disrupting their formations and taking down high-priority targets. His mobility and burst damage make him a formidable assassin, capable of quickly eliminating squishy targets before they have a chance to react. </p> <p> However, Fizz does have his weaknesses. He is relatively squishy and lacks sustained damage, making him vulnerable in extended fights. Additionally, Fizz relies heavily on his abilities to deal damage, meaning that a well-timed crowd control effect can significantly hinder his effectiveness. Champions with long-range poke and burst damage can also pose a threat to Fizz, as they can whittle down his health before he can engage. </p> <p> In conclusion, Void Fizz is a visually stunning skin that offers a unique take on the mischievous Yordle champion, Fizz. With its dark and mysterious aesthetic, Void Fizz embodies the corrupting power of the Void, transforming Fizz into a formidable force to be reckoned with. Whether you're a fan of Fizz or simply appreciate the artistry behind the skin, Void Fizz is a must-have for any League of Legends player. </p> <p> For more information about Fizz and his various appearances, including videos showcasing his abilities and skins, be sure to visit our page dedicated to Fizz on the League of Legends website. </p> </div>" }, { "newPageUrl": "Fizz/Astronaut-Fizz", "content": "<div> <h1>Fizz (Astronaut Fizz)</h1> <h3>RP Cost: 1350 RP</h3> <h3>Release Date: July 9, 2015</h3> <p>League of Legends is known for its diverse and imaginative skins, and one of the most iconic and beloved skins is Astronaut Fizz.
