She was once a renowned sentinel of light, fighting alongside her husband, Lucian, to protect the innocent from the horrors of the Shadow Isles. However, during a mission to eradicate the malevolent spirits, Senna was captured by Thresh, a sadistic warden who imprisoned her soul within his lantern. </p> <p> For years, Senna endured torment and despair within the lantern, her light slowly fading away.
