He is known for his ability to manipulate time, granting him unparalleled control over the battlefield. Zilean's kit revolves around his ability to speed up allies and slow down enemies, as well as his powerful ultimate ability, which can revive fallen teammates.</p> <p>As a support champion, Zilean excels at protecting and enabling his allies. His Q ability, Time Bomb, allows him to place a bomb on an enemy champion, which detonates after a few seconds, dealing damage to the target and nearby enemies. This ability can be devastating when used in combination with Zilean's E ability, Time Warp, which can either speed up an ally or slow down an enemy, depending on the target. These abilities make Zilean a formidable force in team fights, as he can control the pace of the battle and dictate the movement of his allies and enemies.</p> <p>Zilean's ultimate ability, Chronoshift, is what truly sets him apart from other champions. When activated, Chronoshift places a protective bubble on a target ally, preventing them from dying for a few seconds. If the target takes fatal damage during this time, they are instead revived with a portion of their health restored. This ability can turn the tide of a team fight, allowing Zilean to save his teammates from certain death and provide a second chance at victory.</p> <p>While Zilean's strengths lie in his ability to control time and protect his allies, he does have some weaknesses. He is relatively squishy and lacks mobility, making him vulnerable to assassins and champions with high burst damage. Additionally, his abilities require precise timing and positioning to be effective, making him a challenging champion to master.</p> <p>In the lore of League of Legends, Zilean is a powerful mage who hails from the city of Icathia. He discovered the secrets of time magic and became obsessed with the concept of time manipulation. Zilean's experiments with time eventually led to his transformation into a being of pure energy, granting him immortality and the ability to control time itself.</p> <p>Zilean's place in the game is primarily as a support champion, although he can also be played in the mid lane as a mage. His unique abilities and playstyle make him a valuable asset to any team, providing utility, crowd control, and the potential to turn the tide of a battle with his ultimate ability.</p> <p>On the page dedicated to Sugar Rush Zilean, players can find more information about this delightful skin, including videos showcasing its animations and effects.
