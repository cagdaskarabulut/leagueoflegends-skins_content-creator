Born into a humble family, she possessed an unyielding desire to protect and serve. As a young girl, she was chosen by the sun itself, granting her incredible powers and transforming her into the warrior she is today.</p> <p>Leona's journey led her to join the Solari, a group of devout warriors who worship the sun and dedicate their lives to its glory. Under their guidance, she honed her skills and became a formidable force on the battlefield. Clad in golden armor and wielding a radiant shield, Leona embodies the power and brilliance of the sun.</p> <p>However, Leona's path took an unexpected turn when she encountered Diana, a fellow warrior who followed the moon.

She hails from the sun-blessed land of Mount Targon and is a member of the Solari, a group of warriors dedicated to protecting the world from darkness. Leona's past is shrouded in mystery, as she was chosen by the sun itself to become its avatar on Runeterra.</p> <p>Leona's abilities revolve around her connection to the sun and her unwavering dedication to justice. She wields her sword and shield with precision, using them to protect her allies and engage enemies. Her abilities include:</p> <ul> <li>Shield of Daybreak (Q): Leona's next basic attack stuns the target and deals bonus magic damage.</li> <li>Eclipse (W): Leona raises her shield, gaining bonus armor and magic resistance. After a short duration, she deals magic damage to nearby enemies and applies a debuff that amplifies damage from her other abilities.</li> <li>Zenith Blade (E): Leona throws a solar image of her sword, damaging and stunning enemies in its path. She can then dash to the last enemy champion hit.</li> <li>Solar Flare (R): Leona calls down a beam of solar energy, damaging and slowing enemies in the area. Enemies at the center of the flare are also stunned.</li> </ul> <p>Leona's strengths lie in her ability to engage fights and protect her team. With her crowd control abilities and tankiness, she excels at initiating team fights and locking down high-priority targets. Her ability to stun enemies and soak up damage makes her a formidable presence on the battlefield.</p> <p>However, Leona also has weaknesses that players must be mindful of. Her lack of mobility and reliance on close-range engagements can make her vulnerable to kiting and poke damage. Additionally, her abilities have long cooldowns, so mistiming her engages can leave her team without crucial crowd control.</p> <p>In the world of League of Legends, Leona is a respected and revered champion. Her unwavering dedication to justice and her role as the avatar of the sun make her a symbol of hope and righteousness. Whether she's clad in her traditional armor or donning the playful Pool Party Leona skin, she remains a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>On this page, you can find information and videos showcasing all of Leona's appearances, including the charming Pool Party Leona skin.
