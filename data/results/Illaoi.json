She was released on November 24, 2015, and has since become a popular pick for players who enjoy dominating the top lane with her immense strength and unique playstyle.</p> <h2>Background Story</h2> <p>Illaoi hails from the brutal and unforgiving lands of Bilgewater, a treacherous port city known for its lawlessness and cutthroat nature. She is a fierce and devout priestess of the Great Kraken, Nagakabouros, who demands unwavering loyalty and strength from her followers.</p> <p>Illaoi's journey to becoming the Kraken Priestess began when she was just a young girl. She was chosen by Nagakabouros to be his vessel, granting her immense power and a connection to the depths of the sea. Illaoi dedicated her life to serving the Great Kraken, honing her skills and becoming a formidable warrior.</p> <p>As the Kraken Priestess, Illaoi's primary goal is to spread the teachings of Nagakabouros and test the faith of others. She believes that strength is the ultimate virtue and that those who are weak or lack conviction should be purged. Illaoi's faith is unyielding, and she is willing to do whatever it takes to prove her devotion to the Great Kraken.</p> <h2>Strengths</h2> <p>Illaoi is a juggernaut champion, excelling in close-quarters combat and dealing massive amounts of damage. Her kit revolves around her ability to summon tentacles from the ground, which she can use to attack her enemies and heal herself. This unique mechanic allows her to control the battlefield and punish opponents who dare to challenge her.</p> <p>One of Illaoi's greatest strengths is her ability to sustain through fights. Her passive ability, Prophet of an Elder God, allows her tentacle attacks to heal her for a percentage of the damage dealt. This makes her incredibly difficult to kill in extended engagements, as she can constantly regenerate health while dishing out punishment.</p> <p>Illaoi's Q ability, Tentacle Smash, is a powerful area-of-effect attack that damages all enemies hit and spawns a tentacle at the target location. These tentacles remain on the battlefield for a short duration and can be used to attack enemies within their range. This ability synergizes well with her other skills, allowing her to deal devastating damage to multiple targets at once.</p> <p>Another key strength of Illaoi is her E ability, Test of Spirit. With this ability, Illaoi can target an enemy champion and rip their spirit from their body, tethering it to the location. While the spirit is tethered, the enemy champion becomes vulnerable, taking increased damage from Illaoi and her tentacles. If the enemy champion fails to destroy the spirit by damaging it, they will be hit with a powerful slow and have their defenses reduced.</p> <p>Illaoi's ultimate ability, Leap of Faith, is a game-changer in team fights. When activated, Illaoi leaps into the air and slams down, summoning a tentacle for each enemy champion hit. These tentacles attack nearby enemies and become empowered, dealing additional damage. This ability can quickly turn the tide of a battle, as Illaoi's tentacles wreak havoc on the enemy team.</p> <h2>Weaknesses</h2> <p>While Illaoi possesses immense strength, she does have some weaknesses that can be exploited by skilled opponents. One of her main weaknesses is her lack of mobility. Illaoi has no dashes or blinks in her kit, making her susceptible to kiting and crowd control effects. Skilled opponents can use this to their advantage by keeping their distance and avoiding prolonged engagements.</p> <p>Additionally, Illaoi's tentacles can be destroyed by enemies, limiting her ability to control the battlefield. Destroying tentacles not only reduces her damage output but also denies her healing from her passive ability. Smart opponents will focus on eliminating these tentacles whenever possible, reducing Illaoi's effectiveness in fights.</p> <p>Illaoi's E ability, Test of Spirit, can also be a double-edged sword. While it provides her with a significant advantage when successfully used, it requires her to hit the enemy champion with a skillshot. Skilled opponents who can dodge or block this ability can negate a large portion of Illaoi's damage potential and turn the tables in their favor.</p> <h2>Illaoi in the Game</h2> <p>Illaoi is primarily played in the top lane, where her strength and sustain allow her to dominate melee matchups. Her ability to control the battlefield with her tentacles makes her a formidable force, and she can quickly turn fights in her favor with her ultimate ability.</p> <p>When playing Illaoi, it is crucial to utilize her tentacles effectively. Positioning is key, as you want to maximize the number of tentacles available to attack your enemies. Placing tentacles near objectives or in areas where fights are likely to occur can give you a significant advantage in team fights and skirmishes.</p> <p>Illaoi's playstyle revolves around aggression and punishing opponents who underestimate her. With her sustain and damage output, she can often win trades and come out on top in extended engagements. However, it is essential to be mindful of her weaknesses and play smart against opponents who can exploit them.</p> <p>Overall, Illaoi is a powerful champion with a unique playstyle that rewards skilled players. Her strength, sustain, and ability to control the battlefield make her a force to be reckoned with in the top lane. If you're looking for a champion who can dominate melee matchups and turn team fights in your favor, Illaoi is an excellent choice.</p> <p>For more information on Illaoi and to see videos of all her skins, visit our page dedicated to the Kraken Priestess on our League of Legends website.</p> </div>" }, { "newPageUrl": "Illaoi/Cosmic-Invoker-Illaoi", "content": "<div> <h1>Illaoi (Cosmic Invoker Illaoi)</h1> <h3>RP Cost: 1350 RP</h3> <h3>Release Date: November 26, 2020</h3> <p>Illaoi, the Kraken Priestess, is a formidable champion in the popular online game League of Legends.

Illaoi serves as the physical manifestation of Nagakabouros' will, wielding her immense strength to protect her people and spread the teachings of her faith.</p> <p>Illaoi's past is shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that she was once a humble fisherman who discovered an ancient idol of Nagakabouros while out at sea.

Illaoi's abilities allow her to dominate the top lane, making her a formidable opponent for anyone who dares to challenge her.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Illaoi's strengths lie in her ability to sustain herself in lane and deal massive damage to her opponents. Her passive ability, Prophet of an Elder God, allows her tentacles to spawn and attack nearby enemies, making it difficult for opponents to engage her without taking significant damage. Her Q ability, Tentacle Smash, allows her to slam the ground, damaging and slowing enemies in its path. This ability also spawns a tentacle that can attack enemies, further increasing her damage output.</p> <p>Illaoi's E ability, Test of Spirit, is a skillshot that allows her to rip the spirit from an enemy champion. If the spirit is attacked, the enemy champion becomes vulnerable, taking additional damage from Illaoi's attacks. This ability is crucial for trading and all-ins, as it allows Illaoi to deal massive damage to her opponents.</p> <p>However, Illaoi does have her weaknesses. She is heavily reliant on her tentacles for damage, so if her opponents can destroy or avoid them, her damage output is significantly reduced. Additionally, Illaoi lacks mobility, making her susceptible to ganks and crowd control effects. Skilled opponents can exploit these weaknesses and find ways to outmaneuver and outplay her.</p> <h2>Illaoi's Place in the Game</h2> <p>Illaoi is primarily played in the top lane, where her strength and durability allow her to dominate melee matchups. Her ability to sustain herself in lane and deal massive damage makes her a formidable split-pusher and teamfighter. In teamfights, Illaoi excels at zoning and disrupting the enemy team with her tentacles, making it difficult for opponents to engage or disengage effectively.</p> <p>While Illaoi is a strong champion in the right hands, she does have her counters. Champions with high mobility and crowd control can make it challenging for Illaoi to land her abilities and deal damage. Additionally, champions that can poke from a distance and avoid all-ins can frustrate Illaoi and limit her effectiveness in lane.</p> <p>Overall, Illaoi is a unique and powerful champion that offers a different playstyle compared to other top lane champions. Her strength, durability, and ability to deal massive damage make her a force to be reckoned with in the right hands.</p> <p>For more information about Illaoi and to see her in action with all her different appearances, including the Cosmic Invoker Illaoi skin, be sure to visit our page dedicated to Illaoi on the League of Legends website.
