With his mastery over shadows and lightning-fast reflexes, he strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Zed's story is one of revenge, power, and the eternal struggle between light and darkness.</p> <h2>The Story of Zed</h2> <p>Zed was once a young and ambitious student at the Kinkou Order, an ancient organization dedicated to maintaining balance and harmony in the world. Under the guidance of the wise and revered master, Shen, Zed trained diligently to become a skilled ninja. However, his hunger for power and impatience led him down a dark path.</p> <p>Driven by his desire to surpass his master, Zed delved into forbidden techniques, discovering the forbidden art of shadow manipulation. Consumed by his newfound power, he turned against the Kinkou Order, slaying his former master and stealing the Order's sacred weapon, the Shadow Scroll.</p> <p>Now an outcast, Zed formed his own order, the Order of the Shadow, and sought to expand his influence and control over the land of Valoran. With his mastery over shadows, Zed became a formidable force, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies and leaving a trail of destruction in his wake.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Zed's greatest strength lies in his ability to swiftly eliminate his targets with his deadly combination of shadow manipulation and martial arts. His passive ability, Contempt for the Weak, allows him to deal bonus damage to enemies below a certain health threshold, making him a formidable finisher.</p> <p>One of Zed's signature abilities is his Living Shadow, which allows him to create a shadow clone that mimics his abilities. This ability not only provides him with increased mobility but also allows for complex and unpredictable plays. By utilizing his shadows effectively, Zed can confuse and outmaneuver his opponents, making him a nightmare to face in one-on-one duels.</p> <p>However, Zed's power comes at a cost. His abilities consume energy, limiting his sustained damage output compared to mana-based champions. Additionally, Zed is a high-risk, high-reward champion, as his all-in playstyle leaves him vulnerable if he fails to secure a kill. Proper timing and decision-making are crucial for Zed players to maximize their effectiveness.</p> <h2>Zed's Place in the Game</h2> <p>Zed is a popular pick among players who enjoy high-mobility assassins and flashy plays. His unique playstyle and skill ceiling make him a favorite among experienced players looking to showcase their mechanical prowess. Zed's ability to quickly burst down squishy targets and escape with his shadows makes him a potent threat in the mid-lane and even in the top-lane as a counterpick.</p> <p>Furthermore, Zed's presence in the game extends beyond his gameplay. He has become an iconic figure in the League of Legends lore, representing the eternal struggle between light and darkness. His rivalry with Shen, his former master, adds depth and intrigue to the game's narrative, captivating players and immersing them in the world of Valoran.</p> <p>On the dedicated page for Zed on our website, players can access detailed information about his abilities, playstyle tips, and strategies. Additionally, they can explore and watch videos showcasing all of Zed's available skins, allowing them to customize their champion's appearance to their liking.</p> <p>Whether you seek the thrill of outplaying your opponents with lightning-fast reflexes or are drawn to the captivating story of a fallen ninja seeking redemption, Zed offers a unique and exhilarating experience in the world of League of Legends.</p> </div>" }, { "newPageUrl": "Zed/Worlds-2016-Zed", "content": "<div> <h1>Zed (Worlds 2016 Zed)</h1> <h3>RP Cost: 1350 RP</h3> <h3>Release Date: October 1, 2016</h3> <p>League of Legends is known for its vast array of champions and their unique skins.
