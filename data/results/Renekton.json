With his imposing figure and deadly abilities, Renekton strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies on the battlefield. In this article, we will delve into the lore behind Renekton, explore his strengths and weaknesses, and discuss his role in the game.</p> <h2>Lore and Background</h2> <p>Renekton's story is deeply intertwined with that of his brother, Nasus, the Curator of the Sands. Both brothers were once Ascended warriors of Shurima, a powerful empire that fell into ruin. Renekton and Nasus fought side by side, defending their empire against its enemies. However, their loyalty and dedication to Shurima ultimately led to their downfall.</p> <p>When the emperor of Shurima, Azir, attempted to ascend to godhood, his ritual went awry, resulting in the destruction of the empire. Renekton and Nasus were trapped in the ruins, buried beneath the sands for centuries. The passage of time and the corruption of the Void twisted Renekton's mind, turning him into a savage beast consumed by rage and bloodlust.</p> <p>Now freed from his sandy prison, Renekton seeks to unleash his fury upon the world. He is driven by an insatiable hunger for violence and revenge, forever tormented by his past and the memories of his lost empire. Renekton's appearance reflects his descent into madness, with his once-golden armor now tarnished and his eyes burning with a fiery rage.</p> <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2> <p>Renekton is a formidable champion with a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. His kit is designed to excel in close-quarters combat, making him a fearsome duelist and a potent threat in team fights.</p> <p>One of Renekton's greatest strengths is his ability to sustain himself in battle. His passive ability, Reign of Anger, empowers his abilities when he is below 50% health, allowing him to heal for a portion of the damage dealt. This makes Renekton incredibly difficult to kill, especially in extended engagements.</p> <p>Renekton's Q ability, Cull the Meek, is a versatile tool that deals damage to enemies in a small area while also healing Renekton for a portion of the damage dealt. This ability allows him to trade effectively in lane and sustain through poke damage. Additionally, Cull the Meek can be empowered by Renekton's Fury resource, increasing its damage and healing.</p> <p>Another key aspect of Renekton's kit is his W ability, Ruthless Predator. This ability empowers Renekton's next basic attack, stunning his target and dealing bonus damage. Ruthless Predator is a crucial tool for engaging on enemies and locking down priority targets, making Renekton a potent threat in skirmishes and team fights.</p> <p>Renekton's E ability, Slice and Dice, is a mobility tool that allows him to dash through enemies, dealing damage and reducing their armor. This ability provides Renekton with excellent engage and disengage potential, making him a slippery and unpredictable opponent.</p> <p>However, Renekton does have his weaknesses. His early game dominance can be mitigated by champions with strong ranged poke or crowd control abilities. Additionally, Renekton's reliance on Fury management means that he can be predictable in his trading patterns, allowing opponents to play around his resource bar.</p> <h2>Renekton's Role in the Game</h2> <p>In the game, Renekton is primarily played in the top lane, where his dueling prowess and ability to bully opponents shine. He excels in short trades and all-ins, making him a lane bully that can snowball an early advantage. Renekton's strong laning phase allows him to pressure the enemy top laner, denying them farm and experience.</p> <p>Renekton's role in team fights is that of a frontline bruiser. With his tankiness and crowd control, he can disrupt the enemy backline and create opportunities for his team to follow up. Renekton's ultimate ability, Dominus, empowers him, increasing his maximum health, dealing damage to nearby enemies, and providing him with a constant Fury generation. This ultimate turns Renekton into a terrifying force, capable of soaking up damage and wreaking havoc in the midst of battle.</p> <p>Renekton's versatility also allows him to be played in other roles, such as the jungle or even mid lane, although these are less common. In the jungle, Renekton's early game strength and mobility make him a potent ganker, capable of diving onto unsuspecting enemies. In the mid lane, Renekton can utilize his burst damage and mobility to roam and impact other lanes.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Renekton, the Butcher of the Sands, is a fearsome champion with a rich lore and a unique playstyle. His story of betrayal and madness adds depth to his character, while his strengths and weaknesses make him a challenging champion to master. Whether you're looking to dominate the top lane or unleash chaos in team fights, Renekton is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>For more information on Renekton's skins and gameplay videos, be sure to visit our website's dedicated page for the Butcher of the Sands.</p> </div>" }, { "newPageUrl": "Renekton/Prehistoric-Renekton", "content": "<div> <h1>Renekton (Prehistoric Renekton)</h1> <h3>Cost: 975 RP | Release Date: November 19, 2012</h3> <p>Renekton, the Butcher of the Sands, is a fearsome champion in the popular online game League of Legends.
