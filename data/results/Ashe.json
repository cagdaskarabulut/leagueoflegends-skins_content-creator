Champions who can close the gap quickly and stick to Ashe, such as Zed or Talon, can pose a significant threat. Additionally, her reliance on basic attacks makes her susceptible to crowd control effects that can interrupt her damage output.</p> <h2>Ashe in the Game</h2> <p>Ashe is primarily played in the bot lane as an AD carry, alongside a support champion.
