He is a vengeful spirit who seeks to protect the natural world from those who would harm it. Once a peaceful nature spirit, Maokai was transformed into a twisted and tormented being after the Shadow Isles were consumed by the Black Mist.</p> <p>Maokai's past is shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that he was once a guardian of the Blessed Isles, a land of beauty and tranquility. However, when the Shadow Isles were corrupted by the Black Mist, Maokai's essence was tainted, and he became a vengeful force of nature.</p> <p>In the game, Maokai is primarily played as a tanky support or top laner. His abilities revolve around crowd control and disruption, making him a valuable asset in team fights. His passive ability, Sap Magic, allows him to heal himself by absorbing damage, while his Q ability, Bramble Smash, damages and slows enemies in an area. His W ability, Twisted Advance, allows him to root himself to a target, immobilizing them and dealing damage. Maokai's E ability, Sapling Toss, allows him to throw explosive saplings that deal damage and provide vision. Finally, his ultimate ability, Nature's Grasp, sends out a wave of roots that damages and immobilizes enemies in its path.</p> <p>Maokai's strengths lie in his ability to initiate team fights and soak up damage for his team. With his crowd control abilities, he can disrupt the enemy team's positioning and protect his allies. His tankiness and sustain make him a formidable opponent in the top lane, and his utility as a support can turn the tide of team fights.</p> <p>However, Maokai also has weaknesses that players must be aware of. He lacks strong burst damage and relies on sustained damage over time. Additionally, his abilities have relatively long cooldowns, making him vulnerable during the downtime. Maokai's effectiveness also diminishes in the late game when enemy champions have built up significant damage and can easily shred through his defenses.</p> <p>Despite his weaknesses, Maokai has remained a popular pick in both casual and professional play. His unique theme and gameplay make him a favorite among players who enjoy tanky and disruptive champions.</p> <p>On this page, you can find information and videos showcasing all of Maokai's appearances in the League of Legends universe.
