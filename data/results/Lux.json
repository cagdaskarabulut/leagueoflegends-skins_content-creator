Born into the prestigious Crownguard family, Lux possesses incredible magical abilities that she uses to protect her homeland and fight for justice. She wields light-based magic, harnessing its power to both defend her allies and unleash devastating attacks on her enemies.</p> <p>As a mage, Lux excels in dealing burst damage from a distance. Her abilities allow her to poke and harass enemies, while also providing utility and crowd control for her team. Her passive ability, Illumination, marks enemies hit by her damaging spells, allowing her basic attacks to deal bonus magic damage.

This ability has a long range and can turn the tide of team fights when used effectively.</p> <p>While Lux possesses great burst damage and utility, she is relatively squishy and lacks mobility. This makes her vulnerable to assassins and champions with high mobility. Additionally, Lux's abilities have relatively high mana costs, requiring players to manage their resources carefully to maximize her effectiveness.</p> <p>In the world of League of Legends, Lux is a popular pick in both casual and competitive play. Her ability to deal massive damage from a safe distance, combined with her utility and crowd control, makes her a valuable asset to any team.
