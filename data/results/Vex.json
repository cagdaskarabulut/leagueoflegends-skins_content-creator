With her release on September 23, 2021, Vex brings a unique and captivating playstyle to the game, along with a dark and mysterious backstory that adds depth to the League's lore.</p> <h2>The Story of Vex</h2> <p>Vex, also known as "The Gloomist," hails from the Shadow Isles, a haunting and treacherous land shrouded in darkness and despair. Born with an innate connection to the Black Mist, Vex was destined to become a harbinger of sorrow and melancholy. From a young age, she struggled to control her powers, often unintentionally causing misery and despair to those around her.</p> <p>As Vex grew older, her powers intensified, and she became a feared and misunderstood figure in her community. The people of the Shadow Isles saw her as a bringer of doom, and she was shunned and isolated. This only fueled her resentment and bitterness, leading her to embrace her role as a purveyor of gloom.</p> <p>Driven by her desire for revenge and a longing for acceptance, Vex sought out the Black Mist, hoping to harness its power and use it to her advantage. In doing so, she made a pact with a malevolent entity, binding her fate to the Shadow Isles forever.

This ability not only provides her with survivability but also allows her to kite and outmaneuver opponents, making her a slippery target to catch.</p> <p>However, Vex's strengths come with their own set of weaknesses. Her reliance on crowd control effects to maximize her damage output makes her vulnerable to champions who can cleanse or negate crowd control. Additionally, her lack of mobility and escape tools outside of her W ability can leave her susceptible to ganks and coordinated engages from the enemy team.</p> <h2>Vex's Place in the Game</h2> <p>Vex's unique playstyle and thematic design make her a valuable addition to the League of Legends roster. Her abilities and lore add depth to the game, allowing players to explore the darker side of the Shadow Isles and experience the emotional turmoil that Vex embodies.</p> <p>In terms of gameplay, Vex excels in mid-lane and support roles, where her poke and crowd control abilities can be utilized to their fullest potential.

Players can access information and videos of all her skins on the dedicated page on our website, where they can immerse themselves in the dark and haunting world of Vex.</p> <p>Overall, Vex brings a fresh and captivating playstyle to League of Legends, offering players a chance to embrace the darkness and wreak havoc on the Rift.
